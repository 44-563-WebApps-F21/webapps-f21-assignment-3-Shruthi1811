<h6> Hyderabad </h6>
Hyderabad isn't just about <b> Charminar</b> or Biryani. The city is a perfect blend of traditional and modern, 
and boasts of top education and <b> civic</b> infrastructure. If there's any city in India with the charm and
 vibrancy of Venice, Istanbul, St. Petersburg or Delhi, it's undoubtedly Hyderabad.
